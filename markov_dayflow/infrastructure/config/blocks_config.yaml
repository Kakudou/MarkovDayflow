# Markov Dayflow Configuration - Flexible Block Management System
# Configurable for any number of focus blocks per day
#
# This system adapts to YOUR workflow:
# - 2 blocks: Simple morning/afternoon split
# - 5 blocks: Default balanced system with chaos handling (shown below)
# - 6 blocks: More granular time management
# - 8 blocks: Hourly block system
#
# The Markov chain learning adapts to whatever structure you choose!

# Number of focus blocks per day (must match number of blocks in block_config)
blocks_per_day: 5

# Markov chain parameters

gamma: 0.6 # Deadline urgency bonus

# Block-specific configuration
# You can define any number of blocks here to match blocks_per_day
